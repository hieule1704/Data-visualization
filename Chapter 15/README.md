# Data Visualization Project

This project is based on the "Python Crash Course" book and focuses on building skills in data visualization using Python. By working through this project, you will learn how to generate, visualize, and analyze data using powerful libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three key chapters:

- **Chapter 15: Generating and Visualizing Data**  
  Learn to generate datasets and create a series of functional and beautiful visualizations. You'll explore various types of plots and charts using Matplotlib and Plotly, making your data come alive.

- **Chapter 16: Accessing and Visualizing Real-World Data**  
  In this chapter, you'll learn how to access data from online sources and feed it into a visualization package. You'll create plots of weather data and map global earthquake activity, providing insights into real-world phenomena.

- **Chapter 17: Automating Data Download and Visualization**  
  This chapter focuses on automating the process of downloading data from the internet and visualizing it. You'll develop a program that regularly fetches data and updates visualizations, offering a practical approach to ongoing data analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Pandas
- APIs for data access
